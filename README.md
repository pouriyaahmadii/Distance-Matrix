# Distance Matrix and Average Distance to Nearest Neighbors

This project calculates the distance matrix between points in a 2D space and computes the average distance from each point to its three nearest neighbors. It includes visualization using Matplotlib.

## Overview

The code generates a set of random points in a 2D space, calculates the Euclidean distance between each pair of points, and constructs a distance matrix. It then identifies the three nearest neighbors for each point and computes the average distance to these neighbors.

## Features

- **Random Point Generation**: Generates a specified number of random points in a 2D space.
- **Distance Matrix Calculation**: Computes the Euclidean distance between each pair of points and stores it in a matrix.
- **Average Distance to Nearest Neighbors**: For each point, identifies the three nearest neighbors and calculates the average distance to these neighbors.
- **Visualization**: Plots the points in the 2D space and displays a bar chart showing the average distance from each point to its three nearest neighbors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required packages using `pip install numpy matplotlib`.
3. Run the script to generate points, calculate distances, and visualize results.

## Output

The program prints the following outputs:
1. **Randomly Generated Points**: The set of points generated in the 2D space.
2. **Average Distance from Each Point to Its Three Nearest Neighbors**: The average distance for each point.
3. **Distance Matrix**: The matrix containing distances between all pairs of points.
